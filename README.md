# NFT Marketplace Tutorial

## About The Project

In this project we will develop smart-contracts for an NFT Market-Place that has the following features:

- Seller can list NFTs for sale at their desired price
- Buyer can buy the NFT at seller's price
- Buyer can make an offer for the listed NFTs with alternate price
- Seller can accept or reject that offer
- A Platform fee is charged from the payment
- The owner of the Marketplace can add or remove the ERC20 tokens used as the mode of payment
- The Producer of the NFT gets a royalty with each exchange of hands according to ERC2981 Royalty Standard

We will also write test for the positive executions of the above features.

You are encouraged to write tests for the negative executions for example:

- Seller should not be able to list an NFT they don't own
- Buyer should not be able to buy the NFTs at a lower price then the ask price, etc.
